# Spam Detection System with Machine Learning

This repository contains a Spam Detection System implemented using machine learning techniques. The system follows a comprehensive workflow that includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models. The models employed in this system include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Stochastic Gradient Classifier, Random Forest, AdaBoost (ensemble learning), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

## Overview

Spam detection is a critical task in maintaining the integrity of communication channels. This system aims to automatically identify spam messages using various machine learning models. The workflow includes steps to understand and preprocess the data, engineer relevant features, and assess the performance of different classifiers.

## Notebook Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze the distribution of spam and non-spam messages.
   - Visualize key features and their impact on the target variable.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values, if any.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Tokenize and vectorize text data.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features that might enhance the model's performance.
   - Normalize or scale features as necessary.

4. **Select, Train, and Apply ML Models:**
   - Train multiple machine learning models, including SVM, Decision Tree, Stochastic Gradient Classifier, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and ANN.
   - Optimize hyperparameters for each model.
   - Evaluate each model on the validation set.

5. **Ensemble Learning (AdaBoost):**
   - Implement AdaBoost, an ensemble learning technique, to combine the strengths of multiple weak classifiers.

6. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):**
   - Build and train an Artificial Neural Network to capture complex patterns in the data.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Compare models to identify the most effective approach for spam detection.
